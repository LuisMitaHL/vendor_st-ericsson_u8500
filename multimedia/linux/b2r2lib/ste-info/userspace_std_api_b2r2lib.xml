            For numbered lists, outside of the para tag,
            use the tags 
             (orderedlist)
              (listitem)(para) ... (/para)(/listitem)
              ...

             (orderedlist)
             
            For a bulleted list, outside of the para tag,
            use the tags 
             (itemizedlist)
              (listitem)(para) ... (/para)(/listitem)

             (itemizedlist)

            For a table, outside of the para tag,
            use the tags
            (table)
              (title) ... (title)
              (tgroup cols="number_of_columns")(tbody)

              (/tbody)(/tgroup)
            (/table)

            To omit the title for the table, use (informaltable)
            instead of (table).
            
            For hyper-links, use (ulink) tag.

        The client fills in a blt_req struct with all of the information required for the
        blitting job.

        The request method then submits the job to the blitting driver and hardware.
        The driver analyzes the job and splits it into the required nodes.
        If the job is run in synchronous mode, the request method returns only when the
        job has been completed (or has failed). If the job is run in asynchronous mode,
        the request method returns immediately. The client can use the synch method to
        wait for completion.

        When a client sends a request to bltlib, the job is sorted into a prioritized queue.
        When the job can acquire the resources it needs, it is dispatched to the blitting hardware.

<!--        TODO: Description of which features, interfaces of the standard
              that are supported or vice versa.
              Describe the behavior of the implementation for
              implementation-specific features.
              
              An implementation description describes the behavior of the
              implementation of implementation-specific features.
              An implementation-specific feature is a feature that the
              standard does not fully specify or is specifically left up to
              the implementer. All implementation-specific behavior must be
              documented to make the interface usable.
              The implementation description also needs to include sizes
              or values that are specific to the implementation.

              Other implementation-specific information that may need to be
              included is limitations that are brought on by platform
              hardware or software constraints. These constraints change the
              standard behavior of the specified functionality and may impact
              the software accessing the functionality.
              
              Not every standard interface is exposed to the customer's
              domains. Some interfaces are interfaces between platform
              components and only documented in platform internal reference
              manuals.
              
              What to disclose in the documentation about an implementation
              is generally quite limited. Only information that the user needs
              to know about the implementation is to be described.
              Restrict the documentation to phenomena that are externally
              visible. Once information is exposed, other elements may rely
              on it, and changes to the internal implementation will have a
              more widespread effect. Avoid documenting more than is necessary.

			  While the UML model may reference features,                      
              or featuresets or functionality, in the broad sence,
              this table must explicitly list all functions or other
              means of controlling the API that has been modified, extended or added,
              so that a developer knows for each and every function
              that the function does not execute in the same way as it
              would do if implemented by another vendor than ST-Ericsson.
              
              For functions added to the standard, ensure they are
              documented in the relevant header file, using the documentation
              format used by the standard, or doxygen, if the standard's
              header files does not include any documentation.
              
              Ensure that any header files added by ST-Ericsson is linked
              to using (ulink), and that they are referenced in the
              toc-locations.xml file.
              
              What is stated about functions, is also valid if the module
              implements an API in another way, such as using methods,
              operations or signals.               
              
              Use an (informaltable) to specify details on function-by
              function-level. -->

        bltlib supports only a subset of the bitmap formats defined by OpenMAX,
        due to limitations in the blitting hardware.

<!--        TODO: Specify the supported versions
      
              The conformance description can also
              describe the conformance degree (or level)
              according to a definition given by the reference manual
              or by the standard.
              
              Standard interfaces can be implemented in more than one
              place in the architecture. In those cases, the behavior
              of the implementations can differ. Several coexisting
              implementations affect the documentation.
              
              If suitable, different implementations are documented by
              the same category. The documentation shall clearly describe
              that there are different implementations and the differences
              between them. The differences between implementations are
              expected to be small. -->
