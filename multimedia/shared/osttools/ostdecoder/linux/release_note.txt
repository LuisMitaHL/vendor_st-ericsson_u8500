------------------------------------------------------
How to use:
- Examples provided in package (sh/bat command files
   and test directory).
- Help available with "-h" or "--help" option.
- Launching Trace Viewer:
    o Use "trcviewer.bat" to launch the GUI under windows.
    o Use "trcviewer.sh" to launch the GUI under linux.
    o Use "trcviewer.bat --decoder [options]" to launch the GUI and start decoding under windows.
    o Use "trcviewer.sh  --decoder [options]" to launch the GUI and start decoding under linux.
- Connection to STMProbe:
    o Requirements:
      - STMProbe must be installed on your host machine
      - LibUSB library must be installed on your host machine
        * Win32: The "libusb-win32-1.2.4.0" is recommended, you will also need to add a filter for the STMProbe with this version.
	         If you already have a libusb installed or if you just added a filter for the STMProbe with "libusb-win32-1.2.4.0", run the "Test Program" and check that the device "04B4/8613" is present, it should be ok then.
        * RHEL : libusb 1.0 need to be installed and in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    o Trace Viewer: connect to the Trace Server in STMPROBE mode.
    o ostdecoder: use the trace server option with STMPROBE value: "--trace-server-input=STMPROBE" (no other input required).
- Parse splitted files:
    o Enable the --scan-first option to parse splitted files.


------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------
Features:

------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog version v0.6.0:

# 113164  [ENH] Show source file action in OSTViewer
               --> When double clicking on a trace line, 
                  the corresponding source code is dislpayed in an editor. 

# 113307  [BUG] Last frame might not be decoded
               --> OST Frame size was not properly defined (last frame was never complete)

# 114364  [BUG] Support for "%d %{intx[]} "%d" string format
               --> In order to keep compatible test suites with previous versions,
                  a check is performed on the 4 first bytes of the table,
                  and the following rule is applied:
                   - Support of new format: If those bytes correspond to the amount of bytes in the trace,
                   it is assumed to be the size of the table. It is then not displayed.
                   - Support of previous versions: Else: the 4 bytes are displayed as elements of the table.
                   Restriction:
                   - If by chance, the 4 first bytes of a old trace reflects the size of the buffer, they wont be displayed.
                   - If there are 2 tables in the print, they wont be recognized as 2 tables.
                   NOTE:
                   - This implementation is a temporary fix in order to keep test suite alive,
                     although old traces are obsolete.
                     It will be definitely fixed when test suites will be fully updated.

# 114365  [ENH] Display dictionary name in literal instead of decimal value in the decoded window
               --> Fixed both in UI and command line:
                   UI: Preferences allow to choose how to display.
                   CMDline: 2 options are added (by default, they are disabled)
                    -h to display time in HH:MM:SS:mmm format instead of raw ns
                    -a to display Cpu0:component:group:class::method in text format rather than simple MA:CH CMP:TRC:CL values.

# 115205  [ENH] Display NMF decoded frames in OSTViewer and ostdecoder outputs

# 115267  [BUG] Dictionaries data with special characters(&gt; &lt; ...) are not parsed properly

# 115328  [ENH] Format display like Carbide Text output
               --> In order to display the OMX ID like Carbide, formats of 32 bits data "0x%x" are displayed as "0x%08x"
                   * Restriction: All  32 bits data "0x%x" are interpreted as "0x%08x"
               --> The fix should be in the dictionnaries.


------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog version v0.5.0:

# 113165  [ENH] Add a "Save..." button to OSTViewer
# 113166  [ENH] Launch OSTViewer from command line:
  - Use "ostviewer.bat --ostdecoder [options]" under win32.
  - Use "ostviewer.sh  --ostdecoder [options]" under linux.
# 113167  [BUG] Open file dialog text filter paths
# 113170  [BUG] Killing "ostdecoder -P [...]" blocks the pipe
# 113171  [ENH] Add an option to dump the binary trace when -P is enabled
# 113227  [ENH] Throw an error if named pipe is not of the form "\\.\pipe\<name>" on windows


------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog version v0.4.0:

# 111135 [BUG] type %{int8[]} and type %{int16[]} not supported
  - Integer decoding extended to int16 & int8
# 111137 [ENH] Support for combiprobe TS in NS
# 112703 [BUG] Support of type %{ASCII}
  - ASCII/String is a special type as it is not a vector, but data has to be considered as a vector
# 112714 [BUG] Support of type %hhx
  - Was interpreted as ascii data
# OSTViewer enhancements

Limitations of version v0.4.0:

* In case an OST message is formated as follows 0x%{hex[]},
  All values of the vector are displayed in hex format, but the '0x' prefix is printed only for the 1st value.


----------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog version v0.3.0:

# First version of ostdecoderUI based on eclipse
# More tests with different data
# 103698 [BUG] Wrong OST buffer length:
  When a suprious length is detected, it is aligned to the buffer size
# 108411 [BUG] Failure of decoding
  A side effect of #103698 (wrong buffers were allocated)
# 108413 [ENH] Use filename to specify list of dictionaries (rather than explicitely describing them as arguments)

Limitations of version v0.3.0:

* Some mismatch are detected between the formated prints and the traces
  - In case of trace data larger that expected data in the formated string: additional bytes are ignored
  - In case of trace data smaler than expected, a [?] is displayed


----------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog version v0.2.0:

- Inputs: 
  * Support pipes & sockets as IOs.
  * Enhanded printed messages


----------------------------------------------------
Limitations of version v0.1.0:

- Standalone decoder 
  * No dependency on Trace Toolset.
  * Not tested with trace toolset.
- Inputs: 
  * Files only (pipes not supported yet).
- Output:
  * ST decoded messages only (unrecognized messages
     are skipped).
- Dictionary:
  * "options" markups are not taken into account.
- OST decoding:
  * Print tested only with provided examples (only 
     32 bits data & vectors) in hex/dec formats.
  * Printing full data structures not supported yet.
