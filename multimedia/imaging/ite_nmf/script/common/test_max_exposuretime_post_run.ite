# test maximum exposure time value exported by FrameParamStatus_u32_SensorExposureTimeMax_us_Byte0 page element
# in post-boot run. i.e. frame rate is set after giving START command, than ISP is STOPed and STARTed again.

## Important : this test case tests exposure time on the basis of framerate exported by ISP FW in FrameParamStatus_u32_frameRate_x100_Byte0 page element.
