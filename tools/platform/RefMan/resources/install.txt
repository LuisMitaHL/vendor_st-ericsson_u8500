The API reference manual can be used in two ways. The preferred alternative is to use it as an eclipse help plugin, but there is also an html version.

To install the eclipse plugin:
1. unzip this file in the plugins folder of your eclipse installation.
2. Restart eclipse

To use the html version, open the file index.html.
