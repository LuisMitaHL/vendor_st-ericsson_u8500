Date:     03/Jan/2012
PRCMU FW: 5500b0_11_11
AVS fuse version: 0x2
AVS specifications: 0.77

----------------------

Version:  V2.0.3 
Date:     14/Nov/2011
PRCMU FW: 5500b0_0C_0F
AVS fuse version: 0x1
AVS specifications: 0.7

Comments:
New input parameter: a copy of the PRCMU avs structure.
AVS software will only fill this structure. The call to the AVS service is
not anymore managed by the AVS software. 
The main function now returns in 4 different ways. 
AVS_EXIT_SUCCESS if AVS is ready to be activated. PRCMU structure is filled.
AVS_EXIT_UNFUSEDDEVICE if the device is not fused. PRCMU structure is left
unmodified and default voltages should be applied.
AVS_EXIT_UNKNOWNREV if the AVS revision is unknown. PRCMU structure is left
unmodified and policy is to be defined.
AVS_EXIT_OUTOFLIMITS if at least one requested voltage is above maximum limits. 
PRCMU structure is left unmodified and policy is to be defined.


----------------------


Version:  V2.0.2 
Date:     02/Nov/2011
PRCMU FW: 5500b0_0C_0F
AVS fuse version: 0x1
AVS specifications: 0.7

Comments:
Changed the way avs_configure() is called.
The software enabling AVS now has to read the fuses and give them as parameters
to the avs_configure(int, int) function. 


----------------------


Version:  V2.0.1 
Date:     13/Oct/2011
PRCMU FW: 5500b0_0B_0E
AVS fuse version: 0x1
AVS specifications: 0.7

Comments:
Changed the way the voltage is defined from the fused value to the
Petra value to reflect last changes in the specification. Previous release was
applying too low voltages that could lead to unexpected failures.


----------------------


Version:  V2.0.0 
Date:     05/Oct/2011
PRCMU FW: 5500b0_0B_0E
AVS fuse version: 0x1
AVS specifications: 0.6

Comments: 
First AVS release. 
AVS on Varm @400MHz and Varm @800MHz. No AVS on Vape. Gradual Start not enabled.
If one voltage is above maximum limit, AVS will NOT be applied AT ALL and a
generic error will be returned.
If one voltage is below the minimum limit, it will be set silently to the
minimum authorized value and AVS will be applied, no error will be reported. 
If someone tries to apply AVS on a unfused sample or on a sample fused with an
unknown AVS revision, AVS will NOT be applied and a generic error will be
returned.
If the call to the PRCMU service fails, behavior is UNDEFINED (need to talk to 
PRCMU team) and a generic error will be returned. No further call to the service
will be done by the software.
