/*! \page Interface_for_console command-line interface

This acces mode allows user to pilot alsa sound card using standard ALSA 
application. 
This acces type should be used in scope of script devellopement or console used for debug.
<p>	
On User space side, three standard applications allow to manage the sound card : 
- \b aplay : allowing to manage PCM playback (To get details of aplay interface, refer to <A HREF = "http://man-wiki.net/index.php/1:aplay " > Description of "aplay" usage </A>)
- \b arecord : allowing to record PCM data  (To get details of arecord interface, refer to <A HREF = "http://man-wiki.net/index.php/1:arecord " > Description of "arecord" usage </A>)
- \b amixer : allowing to update ALSA controls defined below.(To get more information about ALSA controls, refer to \ref alsa_snd_card) (to get details of arecord interface, refer to <A HREF = "http://man-wiki.net/index.php/1:amixer " > Description of "amixer" usage </A>)

/*! \page alsa_snd_card ALSA Sound Card

Following diagram explains the role of ALSA library and ALSA driver in MontBlanc Architecture.
<p>
\image html ALSA_Architecture.JPG
<p>	
ALSA architecture is splitted between User space and Kernel space. \n
On User space side, three standard applications allow to manage the sound card : 
- \b aplay : allowing to manage PCM playback (To get details of aplay interface, refer to <A HREF = "http://man-wiki.net/index.php/1:aplay " > Description of "aplay" usage </A>)
- \b arecord : allowing to record PCM data  (To get details of arecord interface, refer to <A HREF = "http://man-wiki.net/index.php/1:arecord " > Description of "arecord" usage </A>)
- \b amixer : allowing to update ALSA controls defined below.(To get more information about ALSA controls, refer to \ref control_mngt) (to get details of arecord interface, refer to <A HREF = "http://man-wiki.net/index.php/1:amixer " > Description of "amixer" usage </A>)
<p>
On kernel side, the sound card is controlled in a specific driver "ALSA Driver". \n It uses services provided by the layer "4500 Audio Codec Driver"
to access to 4500 registers (refer to  <A HREF = "https://codex.cro.st.com/plugins/docman/?group_id=1202&action=show&id=80270" > Mont Blanc ALSA Driver Specifications </A>)
<p>	

- To pilot sound card 4 subdevices are available( associated to device 0:
		- \b Subdevice \b 0: it's the normal device to play PCM on "standard" output(handset, headset, handsfree...)
		- \b Subdevice \b 1: it's the normal device to capture PCM from  "standard" input ( analog and digital micros)
		- \b Subdevice \b 2: it's the Bluetooth subdevice. It provides speech/music over Bluetooth link. Audio/speech Data coming from ALSA driver will be routed to BT module via MSP0.
		- \b Subdevice \b 3: it's the HDMI subdevice. It provides sending high definition audio data to HDMI line out interface. 
		Audio/speech Data coming from ALSA driver will be routed to HDMI module via MSP2.
<p>	

- Only one PCM playback is available at a time : 
	- Output can be specified via "Sink control" \n
	- Input power can be managed  via "Sink power Control".
	- Rendering mode can be selected via "Rendering Mode". This control provides the various ways to send data to audio codec.
		- \b NORMAL_PLAYBACK_MODE : In this mode ARM will send decoded audio packets to STn4500 audio codec and audio codec 30 ms FIFO will not be used.
		- \b FM_PLAYBACK_MODE : This mode will provide FM listening feature. Audio codec will receive digital data from IF1 interface which is connected to FM module and then data will be
		routed to some output device like Headset, Speaker, etc.
		- \b FM_TX_MODE : This mode will provide FM transmission feature. For instance, one would
		listen to mp3 streams stored in mobile phone on the car kit. Audio codec will receive PCM data
		from MSP1 through its IF0 interface and then will route this data to IF1 interface which is
		connected to FM module. FM module will then modulate and transmit the modulated data.
		- \b DIGITAL_LOOPBACK_MODE – This mode provides digital loopback capability. PCM data from audio codec interface IF0 will be looped back to IF1 and vice versa. \n
	- Volume and mute controls are provided.

- Only one PCM capture is available at a time :
	- Input can be specified via "Src Control".
	- Input power is managed  via "Src power Control".
	- Capture mode  can be selected : 
		- \b NORMAL_CAPTURE_MODE : This is the classical way of recording. ALSA driver will
		fetch PCM data from MSP1 connected with audio codec interface IF0 and will send to user
		space.
		- \b FM_CAPTURE_MODE :  This mode will provide FM recording capabilities. FM digital
		coming audio codec interface IF1 will be routed to audio codec interface IF0 and will come out
		through MSP1. ALSA driver will then fetch FM PCM data from MSP1 and will send to user
		space (APE).
		- \b ANALOG_LOOPBACK_MODE : This mode provides analog loopback 
		capability. Source organe is fixed to LINEIN, sink organ is fixed to 
		headset. 
	- Volume and mute controls are provided.

- In addition some general control are defined :
	- \b Master \b volume: to manage a general volume that will be mixed with source and sink volumes.
	- \b Master \b mute: to manage a general mute.
	- \b Multi \b channel \b mode: to specify the MSP configuration to allow the playback of several stream in parallel

\section c_ctrl_get_state  To get status of a ALSA controls
To retrieve current state of a controls, use the "get" services : 

To get current sink organ:
\n\c e_stw4500Output_t* p_CurrentSink;
\n\c GetSink(AUDIO_DEVICE_0,e_stw4500Output_t* p_CurrentSink);

To get current source organ:
\n\c e_stw4500Input_t* p_CurrentScr;
\n\c GetSrc(AUDIO_DEVICE_0, p_CurrentScr);

To get current volumes:
\n\c e_stw4500Input_t *p_ScrLVol, *p_DestLVol,*p_ScrRVol, *p_DestRVol;
\n\c GetVolume(AUDIO_DEVICE_0,CODEC_CAPTURE, p_ScrLVol, p_ScrRVol);
\n\c GetVolume(AUDIO_DEVICE_0,CODEC_PLAYBACK, p_DestLVol, p_DestRVol);

To get current mute states:
\c e_stw4500Input_t* p_SrcmuteState, *p_SinkmuteState ;
\n\c GetMute(AUDIO_DEVICE_0,CODEC_PLAYBACK, p_SinkmuteState);
\n\c GetMute(AUDIO_DEVICE_0,CODEC_CAPTURE, p_SrcmuteState);

/*! \page c_sccall_mngt How to do a speech call (audio part only)

it's recommanded to start audio part of the speech call after the modem sub-system \n
MMTE application is used to run a script that start or stop the speech call. \n
Following parts give MMTE usage

\section c_SC_call_start start a speech call 
\c StartSpeechCall(AUDIO_DEVICE_0);

\section SC_call_stop stop a speech call 
\c StopSpeechCall(AUDIO_DEVICE_0);
